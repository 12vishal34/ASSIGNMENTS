    "Answer:The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical functions used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable. The main difference between them is that the PMF is used for discrete random variables, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables.\n",
    "The PMF is a function that maps each possible outcome of a discrete random variable to its probability of occurrence. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the random variable X, which represents the outcome of rolling the die, is:\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "The sum of all the probabilities in the PMF must equal 1, since one of the possible outcomes must occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the PDF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It gives the probability density of the random variable at a specific point. For example, consider the height of students in a class, which is a continuous random variable. The PDF of the random variable X, which represents the height of a student, may be normally distributed with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm. The PDF of X is:\n",
    "f(x) = (1 / (σ * sqrt(2 * π))) * exp(-(x - μ)² / (2 * σ²))\n",
    "where μ is the mean, σ is the standard deviation, and π is the mathematical constant pi.\n",
    "The area under the PDF curve over a certain range gives the probability of the random variable falling within that range.\n",
    "In summary, the PMF and PDF are both mathematical functions used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable. The PMF is used for discrete random variables, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables."

    "Answer:The uniform distribution is a probability distribution where every value within a given interval is equally likely to occur. This means that the probability density function (PDF) is constant within the interval and zero outside of it. The uniform distribution is often used as a simple model for situations where there is no reason to favor any particular value within the given interval.\n",
    "For example, let's consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are the integers 1 through 6, each with equal probability of 1/6. This is an example of a discrete uniform distribution, where each possible outcome has an equal probability of occurring.\n",
    "Now, let's consider a continuous uniform distribution. Suppose we have a rectangular garden with an area of 100 square meters. If we randomly select a point within the garden, the probability of selecting any given area within the garden is proportional to its size. Since the garden has an area of 100 square meters, the probability of selecting any particular 1 square meter area is 1/100. Therefore, the probability density function for this uniform distribution is f(x) = 1/100 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 10, and f(x) = 0 for x < 0 or x > 10.\n",
