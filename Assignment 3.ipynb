    "#1.Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A for loop is used when you have a definite number of iterations and you know beforehand how many times you want to loop through the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to loop through the numbers from 1 to 10, you would use a for loop:\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "in this example, the for loop will run 10 times, starting at 1 and ending at 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop, on the other hand, is used when you do not know beforehand how many times you want to loop through the code. The loop will continue to run as long as a certain condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to loop until the user inputs a number greater than 10, you would use a while loop:\n",
    "num = 0\n",
    "while num <= 10:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "In this example, the while loop will continue to run until the user inputs a number greater than 10. Once the condition is met, the loop will exit."
